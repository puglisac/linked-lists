## Linked Lists

Weâ€™ve supplied you with a Node class and a constructor for the LinkedList class. Here are descriptions of the methods you should write for instances of LinkedList. There is also a DoubleLinkedList class with the same funtionality but using links to prev and next Nodes.

**push(val)**  
Appends a new node with value val to the tail. Returns undefined.  
**unshift(val)**  
Add a new node with value val to the head. Returns undefined.  
**pop()**  
Remove & return tail value. Throws error if list is empty.  
**shift()**  
Remove & return head value. Throws error if list is empty.  
**getAt(idx)**  
Retrieve value at index position idx. Throws error if index is invalid.  
**setAt(idx, val)**  
Set value of node at index position idx to val. Throws error if index is invalid.  
**insertAt(idx, val)**  
Insert a new node at position idx with value val. Throws error if index is invalid. Returns undefined.  
**removeAt(idx)**  
Remove & return value at position idx. Throws error if index is invalid.  
**average()**  
Given a linked list containing numbers, return the average of those numbers.
